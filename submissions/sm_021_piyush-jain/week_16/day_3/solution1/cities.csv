id City        Country_id     City_id 
1  Bangalore        1|1       1|1|1
2  Hyderabad        1|1       2|1|1
3  Wuhan            1|1       3|1|1
4  Cape Town        6|2       4|6|2 
5  New York         3|3       5|3|3

All the ids would be generated by appending parent table id. According to me this way it can be set as unique value
can acess each city,country,continent by using a split function over "|" acting as a separator for category separation
Example when a split function is done on New-York unique "5|3|3" value
the list values can be stored in a variable and using it can access the csv to give that city or country or continent name
Taking individual id can also be used to access that table data.
