TCP/IP:

It is concise version of OSI model.It contains four layer, unlike seven layer in the OSI model.
It stands for Transmission control Protocol/Internet

1. Process/Application layer
2. Host-t0-Host/Transport layer
3. Internet layer
4. Network Access/Link layer

Process Access Layer:-
	This layer correspondes to the combination of Data link and
Physical layer. Its looks hardware addressing and the protocol present
in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data.

Internet Layer:-
	It is parallel to the OSI network layer. It defines the protocol
which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire 
network.

Host-to-Host Layer:-
	Transport layer of OSI model resposible for end-to-end
communication and error free delivery of data.

Process Layer:-
	This layer the combination of top three layer OSI model 
application, presentation, session layer. It is responsible for node-to
node communication.
