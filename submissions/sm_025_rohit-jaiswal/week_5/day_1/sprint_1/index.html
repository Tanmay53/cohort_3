            <b>"If tic-tac-toe were as simple as it seems, why has it been around for over 3,000 years? Our version has evolved a bit since the original version in ancient Egypt, by letting kids play against the computer. However, what it teaches kids hasn’t changed. This classic game contributes to children’s developmental growth in numerous ways including their understanding of predictability, problem solving, spatial reasoning, hand-eye coordination, turn taking, and strategizing.  Teachers trust Toy Theater to provide safe & effective educational games. Free to play, priceless to learn."</b>
