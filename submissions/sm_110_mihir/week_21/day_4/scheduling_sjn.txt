Non Preemptive short job next :-   Job with shorter execution time is given priority and executed first. 
Next job starts executing only after current job is finished executing.

Process |   Arrival time|   Execution time  |   Service time
P0          0               5                   0               - P0 arrives at 0 time so is executed first
P1          1               3                   7               - P1 executed at last
P2          2               2                   5               - P2 has the shortest execution time. It is executed after P0

Preemptive short job next :- Job with shorter execution time is given priority and executed first. 
Next shortest job will start on arrival even if current job is unfinished.

Process |   Arrival time|   Execution time  |   Service time
P0          0               5                   1, 6              - P0 arrives at 0 time so is executed first, runs for 1unit. rest 4units remaining as P1 has arrived
P1          1               3                   1, 4              - P1 runs for 1 unit time,remaining 2units, as P3 SJN has arrived 
P2          2               2                   2               - P3 has the shortest execution time. It is executed completely.

After P2 finishes, P1 remaining is executed and then P0 reminaing units.
