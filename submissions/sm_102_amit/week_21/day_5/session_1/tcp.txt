Process/Application Layer
This layer corresponds to the combination of Data Link Layer and Physical Layer of the OSI model. It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data.

Host-to-Host/Transport Layer
This layer parallels the functions of OSIâ€™s Network layer. It defines the protocols which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network.

Internet Layer
This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data.

Network Access/Link Layer
This layer performs the functions of top three layers of the OSI model: Application, Presentation and Session Layer. It is responsible for node-to-node communication and controls user-interface specifications.
