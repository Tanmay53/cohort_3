Difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling

PARAMETER       PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULING                               NON-PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULING
Basic	        In this resources(CPU Cycle) are allocated          Once resources(CPU Cycle) are allocated to
                 to a process for a limited time.                                                   a process, the process holds it till
                                                                    it completes its burst time or switches to waiting state.
                 	
Interrupt	    Process can be interrupted in between.	            Process can not be interrupted untill it terminates itself or its time is up.

Starvation	    If a process having high priority frequently        If a process with long burst time is running CPU,
                 arrives in the ready queue, low priority           then later coming process with less CPU burst time may starve.
                  process may starve.                                                   
                 	
Overhead	    It has overheads of scheduling the processes.	    It does not have overheads.

Flexibility	    flexible	                                        rigid

Cost	        cost associated	                                    no cost associated



Example: It is a non-preemptive algorithm.

Process ID      Arrival Time    Burst Time
1               2               3
2               0               4
3               4               2
4               5               4

Final Result...

Process ID      Arrival Time    Burst Time      Waiting Time    Turnaround Time
2               0               4               0               4
3               4               2               0               2
1               2               3               4               7
4               5               4               4               8
