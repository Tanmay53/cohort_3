TCP -  Transmission Control Protocol
It has 4 layers.It is more secure than OSI model.

1.Network Access Layer:-
    This layer is combination of Data Link layer and physical layer of OSI model.
    In this data  bits  converted to electronic signal and data packet is encapsulated
    or decapsulated after encoding or decoding.

2. Internet layer:-
    It is similar to Network layer of OSI model.It defines the protocol which is used for 
    transfer of data. Internet protocol is the main protocol here.

3. Transport Laye:-
    It is similar to Transport layer of OSI. It is responsible for jitter free delivery of data.
    Protocols used by this layer are:-
        1. TCP
        2. UDP

4. Application Layer:-
    This layer is combination of Application,Session,Presentation layer of OSI model. It deals with
    user and responsible for end-to-end communication.
    Few Protocols used here are:-
        HTTPS,SSH,DHCP,SMTP,DNS
