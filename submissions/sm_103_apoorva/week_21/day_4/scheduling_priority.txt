Preemption :- In OS,it stands for interupting any process when the processing time increases the scheduled cpu time for a perticular task. So that it can be resumes later.

Priority based scheduling: In this every process has fixed priority and the one with highest priority is executed 1st.

Priority based Preemtive scheduling:-

In Priority based Preemtive scheduling when next process comes in between of execution time of 1st process, 1st process is preemted and next process with highest priority comes 1st.

for eg:-

Process | Arrival time | Execution time | Priority
P0 | 0 | 6 | 1
P1 | 2 | 1 | 1
p2 | 3 | 3 | 2

Here,  P0 will get executed as it starts at 0.it runs for 2unit then P1 comes and P0 is preempted ,P1 runs for 1 unit then again P0 runs for 1Unit and get preempted. Then p2 comes and run for 3unit(as it has the highest priority) then again P1 comes and complete its remaining process

Non-Priority based Preemtive scheduling:-

In this Preemption doesn't happen .Proccesses completes it work then then next process with highest priority comes.

for eg,

Process | Arrival time | Execution time | priority
P0 | 0 | 6 | 1
P1 | 2 | 4 | 1
p2 | 1 | 3 | 2

In the above processes, P0 is executed 1st then p2 then p1
