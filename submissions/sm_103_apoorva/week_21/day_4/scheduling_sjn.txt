Preemption :- In OS,it stands for interupting any process when the processing time increases the scheduled cpu time for a perticular task. So that it can be resumes later.

SJN:- It stands for shortest job next.That is, everytime the process with shortest execution time is executed first.

Preemptive SJN :

In Preemptive SJN when next process comes in between of execution time of 1st process, 1st process is preemted and next process with shortest remaining time comes.

For eg.


Process | Arrival time | Execution time 
P0 | 0 | 6
P1 | 2 | 1
p2 | 3 | 3

In the above processes :
1. P0 will get executed as it starts at 0.it runs for 2unit then P1 comes and P0 is preempted ,P1 runs for 1 unit then again P0 runs for 1Unit and get preempted. Then p2 comes and run for 3unit then again P1 comes and complete its remaining process


Non-Preemptive SJN:

In this Preemption doesn't happen .Proccesses completes it work then then next process with shortest time commes.

for eg,

Process | Arrival time | Execution time 
P0 | 0 | 6
P1 | 2 | 4
p2 | 1 | 3

In the above processes, P0 is executed 1st then p2 then p1
