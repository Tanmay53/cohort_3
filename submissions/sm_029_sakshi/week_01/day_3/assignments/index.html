                 Here is some information on pugs ! 
                <p><b>The Pug</b> is a breed of dog with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled fa
ce, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body
 with well-developed muscles.Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a pa
ssion for pugs which she<br> passed on to other members of the Royal family.
