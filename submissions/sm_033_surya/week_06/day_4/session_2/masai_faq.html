                                    Option 1 - One-Time Fee Student pays at the beginning of the course, a fixed fee of
                                    ₹2
                                    lakhs (Inclusive of GST). No additional amount needs to be paid after this at any

                                    you get a job with a salary of ₹6 lakhs per annum (before taxes). The payment will

                                    is earlier. The Income Share Agreement is capped at ₹3 lakhs. In the rarest scenario

                                    for 36 months. Once you have paid us for 36 months, the ISA is terminated.

                                    month you pay us 15 percent of ₹ 50,000 = ₹ 7,500 per month.
                                    ISA is capped at ₹ 3 Lacs. You'll never pay us more than ₹ 3 Lacs.
